# Existing infrared and visible image fusion methods
For the purpose of comparing the fusion performance of our proposed method to other state-of-the-art algorithms, 17 fusion methods are selected, which are Cross Bilateral Filter (CBF), Sparse Convolutional Representation (ConvSR), Structaware,  Discrete Cosine Harmonic Wavelet Transform (DCHWT), HybridMSD, DenseFuse, NestFuse, DDcGan,MEF-GAN, Image fusion network based on Proportional Maintenance of Gradient and Intensity (PMGI),CNN,MDlattLRR, Multi-layer Deep Features Fusion Method (VggML),Image Fusion Framework based on Convolutional Neural Network (IFCNN) (elementwise-maximum), Unified Unsupervised Image Fusion(U2Fusion), ResNet-Zca, and Residual Fusion Network for infrared and visible images(RFN-Nest) are adopted for comparation.
