# Objective Evaluation for infrared and Visible image fusion 
To evaluate the fusion performance objectively, ten quality metrics are utilized such as Edge Intensity (EI), 
Cross Entropy (CE), (SF), Entropy (EN),quality of images ($Q^{ab/f}$), Spatial frequency Sum of Correlation Coefficients (SCD),
noise in images ($ N^{ab/f}$), Mutual Information between images ($M^{Iab/f}$),Standard Deviation of Image (SD),
Definition (DF)  and a novel Visual Information Fidelity (VIFF). EI and SF determine whether the fusion image extracts more edge and 
detail information; a high value of EI and SF indicates that the fusion image extracts more edge and detail information. Additionally, 
the best value is obtained in EN, indicating that the fused image contains more information. The best value in the SCD and MI indicates 
that the fused image retains sufficient information from the source images and is more similar to the source images. The optimum value in
VIFF, which indicates that the image is more natural or realistic. The optimal values of DF and SD indicate that the contrast of fused images 
is high. The bad results of $Q^{ab/f}$ and $ N^{ab/f}$ mean that the fusion image may have more noise. The larger the Cross Entropy (CE) value,
the greater the information difference between images. In general, among them, the lower the value  of the Cross Entropy and the $N^{ab/f}$, and
the higher the other values, the better the fusion quality of the image.
