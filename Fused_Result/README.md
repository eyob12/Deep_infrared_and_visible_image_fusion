 # Infrared and Visible Image Fused Result 
 The test images were obtained from three datasets: TNO, LLVIP and VOT2020-RGBT. The first dataset consists 21 pairs of infrared and visible images. The second dataset contains 100 pairs of infrared and visible images. The third dataset includes 40 pairs of infrared and visible images obtained from TNO and VOT2020-RGBT. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm the test image was evaluated with subjective and objective evaluation matrix. In Fig.1, Fig.2, and Fig.3 subjective evaluation is showed for the three dataset such as TNO, LLVIP, and VOT2020-RGBT respectively.  Tab.1 shown the objective evaluation of our model with the three well known dataset.To evaluate the fusion performance objectively, ten quality metrics
